                Making music isn't easy. It takes time, effort, and learning. But when you're in the flow, it's
                incredibly rewarding.We feel the same way about making Ableton products. The driving force behind
                Ableton is our passion for what we make, and the people we make it for.

                We believe it takes focus to create truly outstanding instruments. We only work
                on a few products and we strive to make them great.

            <p class="feature__description">
                Rather than having a one-size-fits-all process, we try to give our
                people what they need to work their magic and grow. We've learned that
                achieving the best results comes from building teams that are richly diverse,
                and thus able to explore problems from a wider set of perspectives. We
                don't always agree with each other, but opinion and debate are valued and openly
                encouraged.

                Alongside an internal training program, employees are actively supported in
                acquiring new knowledge and skills, and coached on applying these in their
                daily work. In addition, staff-organized development and music salons are a chance to
                discuss new technologies, production techniques and best practices.
